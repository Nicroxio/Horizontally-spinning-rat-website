This is a website made my the user Nicroxio to praise our lord and savior the horizontaly spinning rat.<br>
He is a litteral god he cannot be beaten by any other creature human or not.<br>
It could be argued by the uninlightened that the horizontaly spinning rat could be beaten by a capibara.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Bristol.zoo.capybara.arp.jpg/220px-Bristol.zoo.capybara.arp.jpg"></a><br>
But that would be wrong, the pure unrivaled power of a spinning rat completely overpowers a capibara with the swift strike of the rapidly spinning tail.<br>
Other powers that the rat contains within its tiny body is the power of an extremely resiliant stomach
